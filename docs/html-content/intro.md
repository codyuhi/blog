# Starting with HTML

## Intro

This tutorial will introduce you to HTML and give you a sample of code that you can use to make your first webpage.

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language."  It's a coding language that lets you define the structure of a webpage.  This means that if you write specific words and characters in a special way (the syntax), you can change the way your webpage looks.

## Directions

 1. Create a file and label it "hello.html"
 2. In the file, type the contents of the code snippet that I've provided here (I'll explain what this all means in a future post)

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

3. Click on the file in your file system to get it to open in a browser.  You should see "Hello" in the browser window and on the tab of the browser that you have open.
