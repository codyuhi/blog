# Blog

## Summary

This repository holds code and blog content for my personal tech blog. The content that I create here will be used to populate the blog at https://blog.codyuhi.me/

## Contents

- `archive`: This directory holds an old version of my blog website. It is no longer supported
- `docs`: This directory holds the content that I've created for my blog. The content is saved here as Markdown content.
- `v2`: This directory holds a new version of the blog website that was started before I decided to just use Hashnode's blog support.

## Next Steps

- Create more content
- Define a more consistent content creation/post schedule
