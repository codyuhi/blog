    <h1>Hi, I'm Cody</h1>
    <h2>This is my blog</h2>
    <p>
      I decided to make this blog website because it provides value to myself
      because I eventually want to chronicle the things I learn in tech online
      so others can learn from my research too.
    </p>
    <p>I hope the things I write can be of help to some people.</p>
    <p>
      Even if not, this will be something for me to keep tabs on for myself as I
      learn new things every day.
